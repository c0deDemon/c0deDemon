### About Me
Hello. I am a 24 year old developer with about 8-10 years experience. I've started developing apps back in 2013 with VB.NET. I learned a decent amount of programming languages in my life of programming. My main programming language is now V.

### Programming Languages
Why do i main V?

Alot of reasons on why i main V. You can do everything and anything from other programming languages in V, even yet some things that other programming languages can't do. V gives you the advantage of doing low level to high level features. Its a nice lightweight minimal language that support everything C can do along with some new extra up-to-date programming language features

List Of Language i can write:
C/C++, C#, VB, PHP, PY, JS, PL, RB, BASH/BATCH, SH

Open to join teams or projects.
